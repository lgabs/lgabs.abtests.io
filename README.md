A one-stop shop for all things in A/B tests! ðŸš€ Unleash data-driven decisions with guides, discussions, and enjoy some nerdy statistical humor along the way. ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤“

Welcome! This will be a website full of mindfull discussions about how to run and analyze A/B Tests, including all its caveats and tools/calculators for doing so. I'm also developing free apps to help you run your analysis with more confidence.

## Calculators
For now, if you want to run Bayesian A/B Tests, you can use my app [Janus](https://lgabs-janus-homepage-yuanqc.streamlit.app/), with many ways of using your input to get results. Enjoy and feel free to open issues about problems!
